## The dataset used is the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset"

### Data description

* The data comprise the results from experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope.
* The 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity are captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
* The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

### Identifiers
* Subject - The ID of each subject
* Activity - The type of activity that was carried out 
    + WALKING 
    + WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    + WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 
    + SITTING 
    + STANDING 
    + LAYING 
   

### Measurements
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

Variables | Description
--------- |-----------------
mean()    | Mean value
std()     | Standard deviation
mad()     | Median absolute deviation

max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

### Data transformations
Data transformation
The raw data sets are processed to create a tidy data set (see run_analysis.R)

1. Merge training and test sets
2. Extract mean and standard deviation variables
3. A final tidy data set where mean and standard deviation are averaged for each activity and each subject.
